# Neural Style Transfer
## Project Overview
Neural Style Transfer is a technique that combines the style of one image with the content of another image, resulting in a new image that retains the content but adopts the style of the reference image. This repository provides an implementation of Neural Style Transfer using deep learning.
## Dependencies
- Python 3.7 or above
- TensorFlow 2.0 or above
- Keras 2.3.0 or above
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
## Installation and Usage 
### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/nishant152030/Neural-Style-Transfer.git
```
### Add paths
Add content and style image path to main.py as shown in figure.
